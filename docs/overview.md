# Overview

Xinput GUI, or xinput-gui, is a simple GUI for Xorg's Xinput tool.

xinput is a command-line utility for managing, testing, and configuring X11 display server input devices. This includes mice, keyboards, and touchpads.

xinput-gui is a wrapper around the xinput command. It aims to simplify the configuration of X input devices for users who aren't as familiar with the terminal, while being more flexible than other tools provided by various desktop environments.

For installation instructions, see the [project README](../README.md).

To learn how to use xinput-gui, see [xinput-gui Usage](usage.md).
