Please feel free to open issues with bugs, feature requests, or any other discussion you find necessary.

Pull requests are always welcome, but please make sure that there's an open issue for the bug you're fixing/feature you're adding first. Pull requests that are submitted that haven't already been discussed likely won't be or will take a while to be accepted. This is the kind of tool that can easily become bloated/difficult to use/get out of scope, so I do want to be fairly careful about what features are added.
